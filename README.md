### DESCRIPTION
  - A Machine learning application to predict whether or not a banknote is authentic.
  - The application is containerized with Docker container and deployed with Kubernetes Engine in Google Cloud Platform.

## MOTIVATION
- To gain experience in executing life-cycle of data science projects(data collection, feature engineering, feature selection, model selection, model hyper parameter tuning and model deployment). To also have knowledge of Google Cloud Platform.  
- To contribute on sharing knowledge to the data science community. 
-  I have seen many times fraudulent clients bringing unauthentic banknotes to buy merchandises from my father's shop. We always realize the banknotes are not authentic after the client is gone because we did not have the tool to do a direct check once the client gives the banknote. So these events have triggered my curiosity to build this kind a of application.  

## DATA SOURCE
The data is source is here [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ritesaluja/bank-note-authentication-uci-data).

## DEPLOYMENT
#### This application is deployed to [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/0105E0-BA667B-65E7D2?organizationId=4929429979).
#### You can access the application [here](http://34.94.25.222/).
#### Note: Making a query may take few secondes to load the data sometimes, as the server may be in hibernate state.

## How to use
- In the application bars type only numerical values(positive of negative values). If you type other than numerical values you will be getting an error.

- Once you type the convinient values click on the submit botton to get the result of the prediction.

## Usage
You can use this project for further developing it and adding your work in it. If you use this project, kindly mention the original source of the project and mention the link of this repo in your report.

## Further Improvements
This was my first web scrapping project so there are things to improve upon

- CSS style is not in the CSS folder instead I have included the style in the html code. When I included the CSS in the CSS folder, it was not having effect on the application interface :cry:
- Frontend can be made more nicer (I am exploring frontend development) :monocle_face:	
- Data is only scrapped from the displayed pages on Flipkart website. One cool **contribution is to scrap the data even from hidden pages**.
- The application can be modularized.

## Upcoming project about web scrapping 
 - My upcoming project about web scrapping will be image scraping. 
 - All the project will be committed to my Github.
